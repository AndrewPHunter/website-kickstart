Website Kickstart is a complete starter kit for rapidly producing multi-page static file websites

# Why KickStart?

1. **Multipage entries** with webpack are a constant source of confusion
2. **Stable starter kit** provides a rapid iterative development environment where you can just worry about coding your app
3. **One command build** Just type `npm run build` to automatically run all your tests and build your app for production
4. **Ready to make your own?** Remove the demo app with `npm run remove-demo`
## Get Started
1. Run `npm setup` - If you forget to do this, you'll see this: `babel-node: command not found`.
2. Delete any .eslintrc that you're storing in your user directory. Also, disable any ESLint plugin / custom rules that you've enabled within your editor. These will conflict with the ESLint rules defined in this project.
3. Make sure you don't have NODE_ENV set to production on your machine. If you do then the development dependencies won't be installed. Here's [how to check](http://stackoverflow.com/a/27939821/26180).
4. **One command to get started** - Type `npm start -s` to start development in your default browser.

## Initial Machine Setup
1. **Install [Node 4.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org)** - (5.0 or greater is recommended for optimal build performance). Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**. 
3. **[Disable safe write in your editor](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#working-with-editors-ides-supporting-safe-write)** to assure hot reloading works properly.
4. On a Mac? You're all set. If you're on Linux or Windows, complete the steps for your OS below.  
 
**On Linux:**  

 * Run this to [increase the limit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16748737/grunt-watch-error-waiting-fatal-error-watch-enospc) on the number of files Linux will watch.    
`echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p` 

**On Windows:** 
 
* **Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**. Some node modules may rely on node-gyp, which requires Python on Windows.
* **Install C++ Compiler**. Browser-sync requires a C++ compiler on Windows. [Visual Studio Express](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-US/products/visual-studio-express-vs) comes bundled with a free C++ compiler. Or, if you already have Visual Studio installed: Open Visual Studio and go to File -> New -> Project -> Visual C++ -> Install Visual C++ Tools for Windows Desktop. The C++ compiler is used to compile browser-sync (and perhaps other Node modules).
